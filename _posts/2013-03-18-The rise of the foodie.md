### It’s hard to put a finger on when it all started. It could have been when cookery books started being coffee-table glossies to drool over. Or when Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's red Land Rover solwed to a halt outside River Cottage for the first time. 

It might just be that we got bored of the same old food staples — the ones that came in with rationing and somehow led us to forget our rich food history.

Whatever it was, one minute we were being derided for the quality of our food; the next we’re leading the world and British foodies were pouring out of the woodwork, looking for their next fix.

Everywhere you look at the moment there’s something fantastic happening with food. From award-winning bakeries and fishmongers through to market stalls and street-vendors selling home-made treats and traditional drinks.

The thing about Britain is that conditions are ripe for this kind of foodie revolution to take place. Our lush, temperate climate is ideal for producing food; and from fruit and vegetables, to meat, cheese and fish, there really aren’t many places in the world that can touch the quality of our ingredients.

People are beginning to realise that — which means they’re rightly becoming much more discerning about the quality of the food they eat. As people’s enthusiasm for food grows and they become more aware of the effort that goes into creating it to the highest standards, they’re also increasingly prepared to pay for it. 

When it comes to workplace restaurants, consumers expect to be able to enjoy the same quality of food there that they can get out on the high-street, or even in the farmers’ market. And if you can’t match that quality they’re going to look elsewhere.

At Eurest we’re as enthusiastic about food as all the other dedicated foodies out there, which means we know what customers want to see in our workplace restaurants. With that in mind, we always make sure our menus offer quality food to reflect the discerning tastes of your people, and we make sure we stay up-to-date with emerging food trends.

It’s all about the food (and the people, service, quality and value...but that’s for another time).
