### You know you’re in dire straits when you’re looking for sanctuary alongside some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals.

Among the regular inmates who call the maximum security prison at HMP Maghaberry in Northern Ireland home, are some of the most dangerous prisoners in the UK. Now it’s also home to a colony of endangered lapwings.

The turf between the two security fences around the prison is what has drawn the birds to Maghaberry. Lapwings are ground nesting birds, and because it’s flat and covered with short grass, studded with other plant species, and home to loads of lovely insects for the bird’s growing chicks to eat, it offers the perfect habitat for them to nest in and breed. And so far they seem to be having considerable success doing so, with 30 breeding pairs on the site.

This is such an important ecological development that the grounds have been declared an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) to ensure the lapwings are kept happy in their new home. The prisoners are happy too, as by all accounts the birds have been entertaining them with their distinctive “pee-wit” calls.

Like the kittiwakes that nest on the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle, these lapwings have found a found a way to survive symbiotically in an environment created by the very thing that could have driven them to extinction: mankind.

They have been able to recognise the threats they face, adapt and come back stronger than before, in an impressive story of triumph over adversity.

And there are parallels to be drawn here between the intelligent survival of a threatened species, and the intelligent networks that can adapt to survive in the face of operational challenges and cyber attack.

For intelligent networks, survivability is about having the resilience to stay operational in the face of threats that serve to bring them down, coupled with the ability to monitor and manage themselves autonomously, spotting the threats in anomalous behaviour.

Intelligent networks are simple and effective. To find out what survival could mean for your network read our new White Paper, The power of networks.
