Rome wasn’t built in a day — but once it got up and running, my goodness, didn’t it do well.

It ruled one of the largest empires the world had ever seen and gave the world cities, language and legend that we still cling to after 2,000 years.

But here’s the thing: you don’t get that big without reason. It takes organisation, efficiency and consistent high performance. Romans made every bit of their resources count — and that’s where their success came from. Even their roads were dead straight, meaning no wasted time. And their military tactics were ruthlessly effective. It took a lot more than a loin cloth and a spear to stop them in their tracks — as people everywhere from Baghdad to Hexham found out the hard way.

But if you think that’s impressive, just think how much more they would’ve achieved with the help of unified communications and cloud-based contact centres. Honestly — It hardly bears thinking about — they’d probably still be going strong.

Had anyone, from the lowliest legionnaire to the most pompous praetor, needed to get things done all they’d have needed was a single, intuitive point of contact and they would be able to get through to the people that mattered. With interactive voice response (IVR) capturing information about the caller and their needs, and intelligently routing each contact to the right skilled agent, there would have been no end to their success.

Whether they wanted helmets or olive oil, Romans would have known they could get things done. Roman businesses could even have used social media monitoring tools allowing them to respond to their customers quickly, directly and through channels that suited them. And with mobile apps to make consumption easier and emails to contact businesses whenever they wanted, Roman consumers could’ve kept the silk route thriving to this day.

So if you and your organisation are looking for success on a Roman scale, take a look at the intelligent CRM technology supplied by BT Contact. With IVR, voice, social media, mobile app, email, web and video functionality, you’ll be amazed by what you can achieve. Who knows — you could even go further than they did, and conquer the whole world.
