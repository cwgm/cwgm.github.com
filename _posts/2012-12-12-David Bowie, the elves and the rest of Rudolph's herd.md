### Christmas is a time of contradictions. On the one hand it’s a relaxing time of year and everyone is a bit happier and more relaxed at work. On the other hand it’s full of stresses and worries, such as how to keep productivity high; how to organise all the presents you need to buy; and how to make sure you don’t overcook the most important meal of the year.

What would be really great is if there was a way to take some of the load off your plate. It seems to be how all the big players of Christmas get things done. After all, Santa has his elves, Rudolph has the rest of the herd; and the snowman had David Bowie.

At least when it comes to your business there are ways of making things run a bit smoother. Intelligent networks — networks that think — are revolutionising the way organisations manage their operations, and are freeing them up to focus on other things.

They can help you maximise the potential of your business by removing unnecessary traffic from your network and allowing you to get more from your applications. They ‘understand’ the pressures your network faces and can prioritise the right activity at the right time. And they can largely manage themselves, while giving you full visibility of your network and applications.

BT is a world leading provider of intelligent networks and application management services, and we typically make our customers’ applications perform up to 200 times more effectively and reduce their bandwidth costs by 30 to 60 per cent.

We work hard to help organisations grow with a network at the heart of their operations, and we’re always investing in the development of new network technology.

And because we know how to get the best out of your network, we can provide you with the network infrastructure to take some of the load off your plate this Christmas and beyond.
