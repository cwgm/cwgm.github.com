### It’s easy to think we’ve come a long way from the days of feudalism, but Bruce Schneier argues that it’s still rife in our modern lives.

If it’s not the banks we keep our money with or the football teams we support, then it’s the devices and software companies we choose to associate ourselves with. Apple or Android; iPhone or Nokia; Gmail or Hotmail — the technology we choose says a lot about us. But is our unwavering loyalty misplaced?

This kind of feudalism has “overlapping, complex, hierarchical relationships”, with oaths and obligations, and a series of rights and privileges. Critically at the heart of this system is protection from harm offered by the vendor in return for the loyalty of their customer. Schneier argues that this model is beginning to permeate the world of ICT security today.

As opposed to the old world of security that centred around users, with consumers themselves ensuring that their systems are secure, the new world has been split along two lines.

The first focuses on new internet-enabled devices — like iPhones and Kindles — where the vendors maintain closer control over the hardware and software than before. The second on those services that hold our data for us, such as email accounts.

One of the big asks of this shifting trend is that we trust the security these vendors offer, which we do because it’s convenient. We like being able to log into our email from anywhere. We like to be able to back-up our digital life and restore it when we lose stuff. And we like the synchronicity of having our appointments mapped across our devices.

We give up a certain amount of control, and in exchange we trust that the vendors we put our faith in will treat us well and protect us from harm. In this system, trust is our only option, and we have no say or control over the security provided.

For the individual and for smaller organisations this has its advantages. But for large organisations it’s not so clear cut. These organisations are used to trusting other companies by outsourcing things like their payroll, but IT regulations often require audits. And as Schneier says: “Our lords don’t allow vassals to audit them, even if those vassals are themselves large and powerful.”

The problem is the vendors will always act in their own self interest, and in essence they own us. We give them our data and trust them with our security, but get very few assurances of protection in return.

There should be limitations on what cloud vendors can do with our data, and rights, such as the requirement that they delete our data when we want them to. It’s a trade off, and it’s one that needs to be balanced. And perhaps, says Schneier, it’s time we step in to create regulatory environments to protect us, Otherwise, we really are just serfs.
