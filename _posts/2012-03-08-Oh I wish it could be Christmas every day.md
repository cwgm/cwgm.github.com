There were the Olympians and Paralympians from around the world that wowed us with their achievements; and there was Felix Baumgartner jumping from a balloon on the edge of space and living to tell the tale. Even the Queen got in on the act (albeit in a slightly more measured way) with her Diamond Jubilee marking a record breaking 60 years on the throne.

But this year we’ve been trying to give some recognition to the unsung heroes; the ones who never make the headlines, but still do extraordinary things in their everyday lives with the help of technology from BT. 

So while you’re sitting down to Christmas dinner, spare a thought for Anthony — estate agent by day, volunteer coastguard rescue officer whenever-the-call-comes — who’s ready to put his life on the line at the drop of a hat whenever the need arises. 

When Anthony’s on the cliff face, he can’t leave anything to chance. That’s why the Maritime and Coastguard Agency relies on BT One to provide the backbone for its voice, network and radio communications infrastructure. 

And what about the patients in hospitals up and down the land, desperate to get home over Christmas? Helping them do that are the hospital workers and clinicians using collaborative technologies.

Take the story of the Whittington Health Trust, where people like Edwina and Sunniva work hard to help patients get discharged from hospital in a timely manner. As social workers they need to be able to collaborate closely with various stakeholders to help get patients discharged from hospital,oh- and to do that they use collaborative conferencing tools from BT One to help make that happen.

Then there’s primary school Tim Groves who uses collaborative ICT to aid the learning of his pupils. The pupils in Mr Groves’ classes use the internet and secure cloud networks to safely connect with their classmates, using collaborative ICT tools to aid their learning, engage with the world and collaborate with their classmates.
