### I went rock climbing last week, on a proper cliff. I’d done a bit in climbing centres around the UK before, but never outside and never off-piste, so to speak.

It was exciting, and a little daunting to be traipsing across a gorge in the Pyrenees to a remote cliff-face with a bag full of ropes and a belly full of nerves. I should say at this point that I was with a friend who’s a climbing instructor. But it didn’t stop it feeling like a risky business. 

So I climbed, and it was exciting, and best of all we were back on solid ground by mid-afternoon. This was risk taking lite. We probably had a more dangerous game of wiff-waff in the bar after lunch, but my thirst for adrenaline was quenched.

The point is that we all take little chances every day, and on the whole they’re worth it. Crossing the road, drinking hot coffee and driving to work all involve a measure of risk assessment. But that’s OK, because (touch wood) on balance we’re usually up to getting through the day in one piece.

The equivalent business processes would be things like allowing employees to check their emails on personal devices; on the whole day-to-day emails aren’t likely to cause catastrophic data leakage, and on balance it probably saves more problems than it causes.

But there are some things it’s just not worth taking chances on. I’d never do a parachute jump, for example, because although I’d probably be fine, the stakes are a bit high. I’ll be the one playing ping-pong in the aircraft hangar.

When it comes to business, there are some business critical processes you can gamble on, and others that you just can’t.

Recent failures in the banking system show how vital computer systems are within financial services. And the potential for devastating breaches can’t be underestimated.

And it doesn’t just apply to financial institutions. Organisations of all kinds need to work out where they can and where they cannot afford to take risks with their business critical activities. Then they need to meet the challenges they face head on.
