Vindaloo is a dish made by the descendants of, or those who lived in areas dominated by, the Portuguese. It is primarily made with chillies, garam masala, garlic and vinegar. The word vindaloo comes from a combination of vin for vinegar and aloo from alho, which is Portuguese for garlic. The chillies were introduced into Goa by the Portuguese, and the garam masala spices were those traded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
