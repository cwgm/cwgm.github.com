Along with Real Madrid legend, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Messi has now scored 18 goals in games between the two fiercest rivals in Spanish football — enhancing his already godlike status among Barcelona fans.

The thing about Messi is that he just doesn’t stop scoring. Game after game, week after week, it’s now more notable if he doesn’t find the net than when he does.

The same is true of Cristiano Ronaldo — a player so dangerous that his former manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, joked this week that Manchester United will need a machete to stop him when they face Madrid in the Champions League tomorrow. High praise indeed.

Believers in fate might say players like Messi and Ronaldo were destined for success. But there’s no escaping the fact that they’ve dedicated long hours to turning raw talent into unbeatable quality.

Only by making regular, considered, consistent effort can they take the steps that lead to success. And only by keeping that effort up can they guarantee that their dedication will continue to pay off.

The effort/reward equation obviously isn’t unique to football, but in the short careers of footballers its effect is magnified.

It’s a sad reality that many of the young players touted for success in the game never manage to fulfil their potential. For many that’s because they’re simply not good enough. But there are some with genuine ability who have their heads turned by big money contacts, fast cars, glamour and adulation. And in a career that lasts not much more than a decade, letting it all go to your head, even for a moment, can mean you never make it like Messi.

In business, too, it’s important to keep your eyes on the prize, and not get distracted by short term success. Real progress is about a regular, considered and consistent push for improvement — and nowhere is that more true than your marketing.

Marketing can deliver short term benefits, but it should be part of a long term strategy for success. There’s no doubt that making people aware of the good work you do — and the expertise you have — is the best way of winning the business to help you grow. But sporadic effort means you’ll never quite live up to your potential; so you have to keep up the good work.
