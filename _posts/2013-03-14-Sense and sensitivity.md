### There’s a pub I know in south Manchester where the bouncers wear bullet-proof vests.

It’s not a rough place, and there never used to be any security at all, it’s just that a few years ago a spate of armed robberies terrorised the neighbourhood, and the doormen have been there ever since.

In this particular place, due to my enthusiasm for my local, I got to know the bouncers. One of them, Kev, is like an extra from a Guy Ritchie film. A man mountain: no neck, shaved head, missing teeth — the lot. He looks like he eats raw liver for breakfast, and throws the scraps on the floor for his Rottweiler. He’s a walking cliché. He’s intimidating, assertive, and he doesn’t suffer fools lightly. All this makes him excellent at his job.

But what I learned through getting to know Kev, is that away from the character he plays while on the job, he’s a lovely, gentle chap.

He loves flowers, he’s vegetarian, and that Rottweiler isn’t a Rottweiler at all — he looks after guide dog puppies in the months before they’re old enough to be trained. What’s more, when the fateful day comes that he has to give up the puppies to be schooled, in his own words: “I cry like a baby every time I have to say goodbye.” What a guy.

So, big Kev has a sensitive side, and frankly I didn’t see it coming. The value of sensitivity is easy to overlook. In all sorts of ways it offers strength where people might expect it to be a weakness. For Kev it helps him do his job better than any of his colleagues. He reads situations so intuitively that he can stop trouble before it starts, and he always makes sure the punters feel well looked after on his watch.

It’s the same for the IT systems that manage the vital functions of the world’s businesses (albeit in a slightly different format). Sensitivity is at the crux of allowing them to assess their state, adapt to changes in demand, and stay functional at levels that are needed for them to stay competitive.

It’s at the heart of all the latest intelligent networks, and is even leading to the development of prediction technology designed to forecast network traffic patterns, including how patterns might change so spikes in demand can be dealt with.

A lot of businesses are completely dependent on application performance to run their operations, and the more they can understand how their performance is being affected — and what can be done about it — the better.

Understanding the inner workings of your network boils down to making it work better, while making it more environmentally and economically sustainable to operate. That’s the real sense in sensitivity.
