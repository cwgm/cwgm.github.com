### As we head towards the start of the new financial year, you’re probably giving some thought to how you’re going to spend your marketing budget over the next 12 months.

So where do you start? It might be worth looking for clues in the Government’s inflation basket — the hypothetical basket of goods used each year to calculate the UK’s rate of interest.

Although this is a basket of consumer products, B2B organisations would do well to learn the lessons of the inflation basket when they’re planning their marketing for the year ahead.

What the basket shows is that in 2013/14 digital is going to be bigger than ever, and that it will pervade businesses just as it has households. eBooks are in, with digital television recorders there too; which hints that the nation’s building momentum towards a digital future means digital marketing opportunities are where it’s at.

Social media goes without saying. But the shift in the way people consume visuals and written words (think eReaders and tablet computers) means old-world print is being replaced by new-world screens.

Although these devices have been around for a few years already, they’ve never been as abundant as they are now. And it’s this abundance that makes a focus on digital all the more appealing for businesses looking to take advantage of the ubiquity of devices.

It’s an exciting development for marketers — and an opportunity to be among the first to the top of the wave.

It’s not about fundamentally rethinking the messages you want to get across. Rather it’s about taking advantage of new and adaptable technologies that allow you much more freedom for expression than before.

One of the most exciting developments is the ability to make content interactive and easily sharable. So from eMagazines and apps, to eNewsletters and infographics, marketers have the opportunity to drive more value out of every bit of content they use.

And because more people have access to more high-tech devices, there will be more engagement with that content, and it’s more likely to be shared — which makes it increasingly worth investing in digital marketing.

So when you’re making your mind up about where to go with your marketing in the year ahead, think digital. And think about the extra value you’ll get by adapting to the changing habits of a nation.
