### The outspoken mayor of Newark, New Jersey, has criticised the US government for its overly formal use of social media.

Cory Booker, a prolific user of Twitter himself, said that the government needs to reinvent the way it uses social media.

“It’s just using it as an announcement system, like you used to listen to in class: ‘The cafeteria will be serving roast beef, and I will be at this place or that place’,” Booker told Reuters. “But that’s not interaction, that’s not collaboration.”

A rising star in the Democratic Party, with more than 1.3 million followers on Twitter, Booker said he can’t be a mayor who sits behind a desk and waits for the world to come to him. So he uses Twitter to engage with people, and often responds personally to his constituents. “On it,” he replied to a resident who complained recently of a broken street light.

For our money the US government, and businesses for that matter, would do well to heed Booker’s advice and think better about how they use social media.

Bland, unimaginative and inconsistent social media activity is often a complete waste of time — and could even be damaging to their reputation.

But such a valuable tool can’t be ignored, so it’s important to get it right. To do that it’s crucial that people realise social media sites like Twitter have shifted the expectations of constituents, customers and prospects.

They expect to be able to have a real dialogue with you, and that you’ll actually interact with them — not just broadcast at them. Only by getting those interactions right can you expect to be able to benefit from social media as a marketing tool.

But those that do it well — like Booker — can become well known for it. And they’ll be rewarded for their efforts with a booming online reputation that will ultimately lead to votes or sales, depending on what they’re looking for.
