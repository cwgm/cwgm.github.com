From dodgy wiring, to ropey rope bridges, people get things done in the most surprising ways. I had a Turkish shave in Istanbul once, and the barber was using a polished hub-cap as a mirror.

And why not? It clearly worked for him, and I had the best shave of my life. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

The point here is that just because there may be technologically superior ways of doing things — mirrors that are mirrors for example — it doesn’t mean they’re necessarily better ways.

It’s a question of what’s fit for purpose. Often simplicity is the most logical approach to getting things done, and compromise is the best way to get it done cost-effectively.

For example, it would be pointless for local authorities to put HD cameras in speed traps if cheaper, standard lenses do the job at a fraction of the price.

The same applies to all areas of your business. It’s easy to fall prey to the idea that, because it’s the latest technology, it’s the best and you have to have it.

Think about your supply chain. Obviously you want total visibility of what’s where, when. But instead of the latest satellite tracking systems sometimes you just need good old fashioned, accurate inventory information.

One way of collating this information across a complicated supply line is BT Global Trace.

It works by collecting and combining data from all supply chain partners, delivering all the information needed to one intuitive interface.

It’s automated, meaning there’s no room for human error, but at the heart of the Global Trace system is simple visibility of the information that matters to you, no frills, no fanfare; it just works.
