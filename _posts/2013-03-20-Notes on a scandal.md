### You have to feel sorry for whoever mans the Twitter feed at the Evening Standard.

They’ve been suspended ‘pending an investigation’ after the paper shot its load and prematurely posted an image of its front page (complete with all the important bits of today’s budget) before the chancellor had even shot his cuffs and flexed his jowls.

Predictably the country is awash with chatter. And as the row continues, I can’t help feeling that it’s already been blown well out of proportion. Nevertheless, there are some interesting points to address and important lessons to be learned.

In response to a burgeoning scandal, <a href="//blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100208158/budget-2013-dont-scapegoat-the-evening-standards-tweeter-its-probably-just-some-poor-kid-on-23k" target="_blank">Tom Chivers, in the Telegraph, spoke out in defence of the tweeter</a>, saying: ‘The person responsible would have been someone no older than 25, who tweets the front page every day, and who is probably paid about £18,000 a year on a temp contract to be in charge of the social media stuff. 

‘He or she would have tweeted the front page as usual, because it wouldn't have occurred to them that this is a Special Front Page. And now they're getting the heat from a whole country.’

And he’s probably right. We can all imagine how it happened — a simple accident is all. What’s particularly interesting is the idea that some junior employee at the Standard would be ‘in charge of the social media stuff’, as if it was just a way to keep them occupied throughout the day.

There’s nothing wrong with being junior. Rather it’s the idea that seemingly no one (junior or otherwise) had thought about the potential implications of every tweet sent.

Despite the growth and reach of social media, organisations of all sorts — even savvy ones like the Evening Standard — continue to treat one of the most powerful interactive tools around as ‘stuff’, palming it off without a thought.

Everyone sees it all the time. And that’s why we all know Tom Chivers is almost certainly right in his age/responsibility/salary appraisal of the person at the Evening Standard. The person who, until their suspension earlier today, was wielding the power to reach more people at the touch of a button than any front page ever could.

Until organisations fully understand the power of social media, and the potential pitfalls that come with it, there will always be slip-ups like we’ve seen today. And only when businesses stop thinking of their social media strategies as ‘social media stuff’, will they really be able to make it work for them.
