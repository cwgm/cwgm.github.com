First it was the tools of heavy industry and construction that changed the face of our towns and cities. Now it’s the digital technology that’s changing the way we communicate, shop, entertain ourselves and work.

With the digital capabilities out there, the Government has set about using them to reshape public service for the better, forever. To that end it has set the target of having the majority of requests for public services to be made online by 2013. The problem is that 16.3 million people in the UK have never even been online, and there are still whole areas of the country where the performance of broadband connections is lower than elsewhere.

On the whole these areas are rural, in areas where people live further from their local exchange, and places where the deployment of superfast broadband cannot be justified on purely commercial grounds.

To solve the problem, the government is investing some £850 million over the next two parliaments to give remoter communities access to the latest networking capabilities. The plan is simple: for the UK to have “the best super-fast broadband network in Europe”.

We started helping these remote people get online 10 years ago, and over the years we’ve worked with a number of partners — both public and private sector — to show people the benefits of getting online, and to install the infrastructure to help make it happen. So far thousands of people have benefitted. And as a lead partner of Race Online 2012 we’ve committed to get another 100,000 more Britons online by the end of the year. 

We’re also working with Cornwall Development Company to bring superfast broadband to at least 80 per cent of premises in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, which will make it one of the best connected regions in the world. The project will boost the county’s economy by creating new opportunities for existing businesses, attracting inward investment and improving the delivery of education and public services.
