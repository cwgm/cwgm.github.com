### Staggering footage from Russia today shows a fireball streaking through the sky as a large meteor fragment landed in a lake near Chebarkul, in the Urals.

The meteor sent out shockwaves so strong that it smashed windows, shook buildings, and left people rooted to the spot in awe.

If you get a chance to take a look at the footage do. It’s like a scene from Deep Impact, or Armageddon, or some other apocalyptic film. And it was no harmless spectacle, with more than 950 people injured in the strike.

And it could’ve been even worse. If the asteroid passing the earth tonight were to hit us, it could wipe out a city the size of London. Luckily the scientists are saying that one will miss — a mere 28,000km from the ground. Phew.

At asabell we don’t buy the idea that all publicity is good publicity. And the news from Russia shows that not all impact is good either.

But a clear message delivered in the right way to the right people can have a big impact with positive results. Take a powerful email campaign; a cleverly written blog; or even a great bit of reactive social media. All of them can lend your campaign real weight, without any of the collateral damage associated with sloppiness and poor thought.

But that impact does require a bit of expertise, and we’ve got that by the bucket load.
