### Street food is having quite a renaissance. Just look at the humble hot dog.

There was a time when hot dogs were a relatively elite food, way back when, before they went stateside. They weren’t called hot dogs then of course, but Frankfurters or Wieners, after the cities they came from in Germany and Austria. 

Introduced to the US by German immigrants in the 19th century, over time they became the archetypal all-American street food, familiar the world over. In fact hot dog carts in working districts were one of the first forms of workplace catering. 

By the late 20th century hot dogs had become the preserve of the generic mass market; the sort of things you paid through the nose for at cinemas and fairgrounds. Standards slipped and the hot dog became sidelined by snobbery.

Well all that has changed, and the virtues of a good, old-fashioned hot dog are being rediscovered and reborn; hot dogs have gone pedigree. 

A new breed of frankfurter is on the rise, and a recent episode of Radio 4’s The Food Programme set Tom Parker Bowles investigating the new trend for gourmet hot dogs as an extension of a wider swell of enthusiasm for high-quality street food.

Making a proper hot dog is actually extremely labour intensive, and it’s taken some top chefs to get hot dogs back into the mainstream. 

At Eurest we always look to serve things that people are excited about eating, which is why, along with some other great new things on our menus, we’re starting to offer delicious hot dogs to our customers. 

It’s all part of our ongoing efforts to bring exciting new street-food trends to people in your workforce, so they can get delicious food every day of the week with the added buzz of being slap-bang on trend.
