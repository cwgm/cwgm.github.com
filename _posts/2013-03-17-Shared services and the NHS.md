### The collaborative nature of the NHS means shared services have already become an important feature of its operations.

Historically, logic has made it this way, and while it hasn’t always been collaboration based on ICT, network technology is now helping to reshape public service for the better, and the NHS is reaping the benefits.

The N3 broadband network, the NHS Electronic Staff Record and the NHS Shared Business Service (for back office processes) are all examples of how a single, nationwide application can be used to drive efficiencies in a widely stretched organisation.

And on a regional basis shared services are beginning to blossom. One of the most impressive is the North East Patches Shared System Group for finance and procurement services which is managed by Northumbria Healthcare, but has members from as far afield as Taunton and Somerset. There are other examples too, including one service run in Lancashire and utilised by partners in Norfolk & Suffolk, Coventry & Warwickshire and London. The list continues to grow.

The reason shared services work so well for the NHS is that although large healthcare trusts operate autonomously in the main, they have complimentary operational needs. And beyond the operational parallels, individual NHS workers see themselves as being part of a larger whole, and freely think beyond their own locality; they work for the NHS — not just the Trust they walk into every day. This lends itself very well to collaboration.

Already the NHS’s dedicated broadband infrastructure — the N3 network — has provided a secure collaborative platform for NHS organisations to exchange information and resources. With more than 51,000 connections throughout England and Scotland, it’s one of the largest VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) in Europe, already saving the NHS around £115m a year.

As the PSN (Public Service Network) continues to grow, a dedicated broadband network will continue to play a big role in its evolution.

One thing is for sure; as the PSN continues to evolve, and healthcare providers find it ever easier to collaborate with each other, NHS bodies around the country will continue to find the IT-led efficiencies they need to provide the best service in the face of tough economic challenges. And with the new infrastructure in place, as we emerge from the downturn the NHS and the public sector in general will have the systems in place to help them be better than ever before.
