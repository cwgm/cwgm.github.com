### When you’re trying to get your head around the growth of digital as a marketing tool, it’s important to understand where the trend has come from.

For the first time in history the growth of new technology is being fuelled by consumers rather than the businesses they work for, with people more likely to have the latest technology at home than in the office.

Directly or not, this consumerisation of technology has led to a change in the expectations people have about how they live and do business. The always-on connectivity we’ve come to expect, and the faceless interaction we’ve come to value, have rewritten the rules. And if you have a problem then you expect to have it dealt with when you want, how you want, by someone who cares.

And it is this expectation that has taken the power out of the hands of businesses and put it firmly into the hands of their customers. Because people are connected at all hours of the day and night, so it follows that they should want the freedom to interact with businesses beyond traditional office hours. And it’s this change that has the biggest implications for your marketing.

In an instant a blog, tweet, or video clip can be seen by millions around the world, and your reputation could be on the line in seconds. It means that with technology magnifying the influence of your customers, consideration is needed to help your business win over hearts and minds.

Because of the power given to them by technology your customers expect to be able to have a real dialogue with you, and that you’ll actually interact with them — not just broadcast at them.

Only by understanding the changing face of your customer relationships and making a success of those interactions can you expect to make a success of your digital marketing strategy.

Whether or not you’re able to make a success of your digital marketing strategy will depend on the quality of the conversations you can build with the people that matter to you — your customers and prospects. And since digital is the way marketing is going, it’s probably about time you started to focus your attention on making your voice heard online.
