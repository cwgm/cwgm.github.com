### Usage

Resources provided on this site are free to download and use at your own leisure under the MIT license. The above copyright notice or licensing URL shipped with the resource shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. This includes, but is not limited to, plugins, extensions and code snippets/downloads.

### Creating Plugins/Extensions

Creating plugins/extensions from the resources found on this site must be released free of charge and are in no form sold commercially. If your plugin/extension fails to meet this criteria then it is prohibited to use any part of the resource in your plugin/extension.

Any plugins/extensions created that include substantial portions of any resource found on this site require original author attribution and licensing agreement under MIT.

### Resource Linking

Linking to the resources is fully permitted and encouraged, though linking to the direct article and not the download/demo itself is a smarter idea, as links/hosts/structure are often subject to change. Recreating and hosting demos is not permitted, but recreating a design for screenshot purposes is fully permitted.
