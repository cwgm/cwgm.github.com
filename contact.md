### General

To get in touch about anything, email me:
<a href="mailto:todd@toddmotto.com">todd@toddmotto.com</a>

I'm not currently looking for job opportunities or other arrangements.

### Code support/queries or ideas

While I do try to respond to everybody, in some cases I can't help everybody. For code support, please include either a JSFiddle or working online URL in your email, otherwise your question may go unanswered.

If you happen to come across any errors or bugs in any of the downloads, then please submit the information in the form below. If you've got an idea for an article or tutorial/download you'd like to see on front-end technology, drop it in the form below and I'll get back to you on your idea.

### HTML5 Blank support
For WordPress queries please use the WordPress Support Forums beforehand. If you're looking for HTML5 Blank theme support, then please leave your comment on the [landing page](http://html5blank.com) for others to benefit. Please include a question of decent length and necessary information, one line questions relating to individual support are usually unanswered as no practical information is provided.
